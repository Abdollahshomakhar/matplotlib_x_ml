# 📊 Interactive ML Visualization  

This repository contains interactive visualization tools for understanding basic machine learning concepts such as **Logistic Regression decision boundary** and **K-Means clustering**.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
- Interactive plots using `matplotlib`  
- Add points on click to visualize decision boundaries  
- Explore **logistic regression classification** with thresholding  
- Simulate **K-Means clustering** step by step with initial centroids  

## ⚙️ Features  
1. **Logistic Regression Demo**  
   - Add training points dynamically by clicking on the plot  
   - Visualize how the decision boundary shifts  

2. **Linear Classification Demo**  
   - Interactive classification without logistic activation  

3. **K-Means Clustering Demo**  
   - Add points dynamically  
   - Update centroids over iterations  
   - Observe cluster assignments visually
